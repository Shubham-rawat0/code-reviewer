# How It Works
1️⃣ File Upload

User uploads any code file → content is read and placed inside the editor.

2️⃣ Language Auto-Detection

The extension is mapped to a language:

{
  js: "javascript",
  ts: "typescript",
  py: "python",
  cpp: "cpp",
  c: "c",
  java: "java",
  go: "go"
}

3️⃣ Scrollable Editor

The code viewer grows with the content but stays scrollable, preventing overflow issues.
